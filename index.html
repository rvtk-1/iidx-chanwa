                <h1>IIDX Chinese Pushbutton Sanwa Mod (Chanwa)</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Don't have enough money to buy yourself a set of Sanwas? Can't be bothered to order a set of Samducks? Then this little guide may help you get by with Chinese generic pushbuttons! Obviously these don't feel or sound as good as the real deal (OBSA-45UK), but this simple mod gives generic buttons a similar linear action to Sanwa. The sound of the buttons is still totally different, but that wasn't really in scope for this modification. I should mention that these are the generic button that Yuan ships with his controllers, but I'm pretty sure they're all the same. There's a video near the bottom showing the end result of the mod if you want to skip ahead!
                </p>
                <p>The main drive for this modification (other than as an experiment) was because of how loud OBSA-45UK are. I have very thin walls at my place, as much in some places that I can hear my neighbour snoring, or their phone vibrating when they receive messages. The generic buttons available on AliExpress etc are a lot quieter in general than Sanwa - probably due to being made from slightly different plastics (Sanwa plastic feels harder than generic), so I wanted to use these in my controller to avoid complaints from neighbours. The generic buttons also have enough room under the plunger to add small pads of material (pictured at the end of this page), to deaden the sound even more! </p>
                <p>The main differences in the feel between Sanwa and generic pushbuttons is the height the keys sit at when not actuated, and the distance the button travels before it even comes into contact with the microswitch. Below you can see a generic button on the left, compared to an OBSA-45UK on the right:</p>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <div><img src="assets/img/10.jpg"></div>                    
                    <div><img src="assets/img/9.jpg"></div>
                </div>
                <p>The generic button sits a lot closer to the microswitch than the Sanwa. This is even example of a generic button with a gap at all - most generic buttons I have seen are always in  direct contact with the switch. This means Sanwa pushbuttons have a little bit more travel before they come into contact with the microswitch, then with more travel to actuate the switch.</p> 
                <p>So the idea of this mod is extremely simple - file the small gap where the plunger feet rest to allow the button to travel further, increase the gap between that and the switch, and enable the buttons to sit slightly higher to match that of Sanwa. Pictures below show a before and after of filing this little gap down. I used a tiny round file and it came out a little shoddy, so probably best to use a flat file instead... Also, be careful not to over-file or the buttons will sit too high.</p>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <div><img src="assets/img/1.jpg"></div>                    
                    <div><img src="assets/img/4.jpg"></div>
                </div>
                <p>Here's a side by side of the Generic after the mod and a stock Sanwa:</p>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <div><img src="assets/img/6.jpg"></div>
                </div>
                <p>... and also an after photo of the buttons from the top, showing the height of the new modified button:</p>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <div><img src="assets/img/3.jpg"></div>
                </div>
                <p>That's basically it! You can see the video below for an end result (the video also probabl explains the mod better than all the guff above!). In the video, button 1 is modified Chinese generic with silent mod, button 3 is modified Chinese generic without silent mod, and button 5 is Sanwa OBSA-45UK. I didn't have the keypanel screwed down so annoyingly the quiet-modded button sounds super loud...</p>

                </div>

                <br />
                <p>Finally, if you want to make your buttons even quieter, you can just pop a couple of bits of material under each plunger. The material only has to be thin and makes all the difference!</p>
